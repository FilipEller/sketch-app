The project is making good progress.
Currently, the user can draw (using ShapeTool object) rectangles, squares, ellipses and circles (of Shape class)
from the GUI (which I've made with Scene Builder / FXML and CSS)
and the drawing (Drawing class) can be organized on multiple layers (Layer class).

Initially I was having a bit of trouble with Git.
I was tracking some environment dependent Idea and SBT files,
which caused issues because I'm working on two computers using different OSs.
Now I've got it fixed.

Understanding JavaFX components and learning to use Scene Builder took quite a while,
and I had some trouble connecting a ScalaFX app and controller with FXML.
I have figured out that too now.

I'm on schedule progresswise, although timewise I have used
10 more hours than I had planned to get to this point.
I've used 30 hours, but my schedule says only 20 hours would have been needed.
